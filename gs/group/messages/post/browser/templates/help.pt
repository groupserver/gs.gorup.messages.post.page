  <h3>Post</h3>
  <p>
    A post on the web is made up of six parts: a title, navigation links,
    information about the post, the share box,
    the body of the message, and then a list of files that were posted
    along with the message.

    <p>
      The title reads <q>Post in&#8230;</q> followed by the name of

    <h4>Information about the Post</h4>
    <p>
      There are two items of information about the post:
      who made the post and when the post was made.
    <p>
      The name of <strong>the author</strong> appears at the top of
      the post, after the word <samp>From</samp>.
      Clicking on the group members name will show his or her profile page.
      If the author has added <strong>a profile photo</strong> it will
      appear at the left of the post, below the name of the author.
    </p>
    <p>

  <div class="section" id="gs-group-messages-post-body">
    <h4>Body</h4>
    <p>
      The body of the message is divided in two parts.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Main Message</dt>
      <dd>The main part is message that the author wrote.</dd>
      <dt>Quoted Text</dt>
      <dd>
        Sometimes people will include the text of previous messages
        at the bottom of a post.
        A &#9654; will appear at the bottom of the main message if this
        <em class="wordasword">quoted</em> text is present.
        <ul>
          <li>Click the &#9654; to show the quoted text.
            The quoted text will be shown and the &#9654; will turn into a
            &#9660;.</li>
          <li>Click the &#9660; to hide the quoted text.
            The quoted text will then be hidden and the &#9660; will turn
            into a &#9654;.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
